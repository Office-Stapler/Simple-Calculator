# Simple-Calculator
A very simple calculator

This is a simple C calculator which prioritises in 3D vectors. I plan to improve the calculator bit by bit and even want to add
matrix calulations.

What the calculator has so far:
  - Cross product of 2 3D vectors
  - Magnitude of a 3D vector
  - Dot product of 2 3D vectors
  - Addition of 2 3D vectors
  - Scaling of a 3D vector
  - Projections of one vector on another
